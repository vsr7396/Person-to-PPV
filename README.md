# Person-to-PPV
Statistical Data Analysis to assign the person to the PPV by using three different methods

Two datasets are used, namely, people.csv and ppv.csv. The first dataset consists of 10000 vaccinees’ locations while the second dataset represents 100 vaccination centers’ locations. All the locations are given by the latitudes and longitudes. The aim of this project is to assign vaccinees to vaccination centers. The assignment criterion is based on shortest distances.

The Python program for each different method is saved separately and run 50 times on 2 different computers, whose specs are given below. The running time of the programs is also recorded.
